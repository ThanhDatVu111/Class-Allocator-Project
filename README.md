# Class-Allocator-Project

# Purpose:
In the dynamic landscape of education, the ClassMate Allocator serves as a powerful tool for seamless class selection and student allocation. This application streamlines the process of assigning students to 37 different classes based on their preferences. The keys within the system represent individual classes, and the allocation follows a first-come, first-served logic.

# Usage:
This application enables quick access to student information within specific classes using key numbers. By employing a hash function and linked list logic, it efficiently allocates and manages student data. This feature is invaluable for scenarios where rapid access to individual student details is necessary, eliminating the need for exhaustive searches through extensive lists.
